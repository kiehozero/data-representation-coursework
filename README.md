# ATU Data Representation

This is a repository for the lecture, lab and assignment material covered in the ATU Data Representation module, completed as part of the Higher Diploma in Computing (Data Analytics).

## Lectures

This section consists mainly of the PowerPoint slides of each week's lectures, alongside any introductory and walkthrough code. None of this is to be considered original work.

## Laboratory Exercises

This section consists of the weekly laboratory exercises set by the lecturer as a learning aid. I have no distinguished between my own original solutions and those provided by the lecturer as they do not ultimately count towards the assessment grade.

## Assignments

This section consists of the weekly tasks set by the lecturer to count towards assessment. All code here is original work unless otherwise stated and referenced within comments or below.

## Project

This section consists of all work associated with the final project for assessment. All code here is original work unless otherwise stated and referenced within comments or below.
